# Exercises


Suppose you flip a coin n=10 times and observe heads k=7 times (heads are coded as 1s). Our model for the data is the Binomial distribution.



```{r}
# Compute the p-value for the null hypothesis: θ=.5 of a fair coin.
# Hint: Use the dbinom function.
dbinom(7,10,.5)

#Plot the likelihood curve for possible values of θ. Which value maximizes the likelihood?


```


```{r}
require('coda')
require('rjags')
require('R2jags')


ms='
model {
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1) 
  k ~ dbinom(theta, N)
}
'

params = c('theta')
data = list('k' = 7, 'N' = 10)
model = jags.model(textConnection(ms), data = data,
                   n.chains = 3, n.adapt = 1000, quiet = TRUE)
samples = coda.samples(model, variable.names = params, n.iter = 10000)
